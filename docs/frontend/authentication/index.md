# Authentication Overview

The **Authentication** section of Xautomataâ€™s documentation provides a comprehensive look at user authentication processes within the platform. Authentication involves multiple workflows to ensure secure access, manage user sessions, and handle related actions, such as resetting passwords and accepting terms and conditions. Each process in this section is documented with its purpose, flow, and code references.

## Authentication Processes

The following processes are included in the Authentication section:

- **[Login](./login.md)**: Covers the user login process, detailing the flow from credential entry to token management and session handling.
- **[Logout](./logout.md)**: Explains how to securely end a user session, including token invalidation and session cleanup.
- **[First Login](./first_login.md)**: Describes the onboarding process for new users during their initial login, including account setup and customer assignment.
- **[Reset Password](./reset_password.md)**: Provides the workflow for password recovery and reset, detailing user interactions and API calls.
- **[Terms and Conditions](./terms_conditions.md)**: Outlines how users accept or reject terms and conditions, with API references for status updates.

## Technical Structure

### Key Components

Authentication processes in Xautomata rely on several key components and files:
- **Views**: The primary user interfaces for each authentication process are defined in individual Vue components under `src/authentication/views`. These include `LoginView.vue`, `LogoutView.vue`, `ResetPasswordView.vue`, and others.
- **Stores**: User authentication state is managed within the `auth` and `user` stores located in `src/authentication/stores`. These stores handle session tokens, user data, and state persistence.
- **API Services**: All API calls related to authentication are implemented in `Api.ts` under `src/services`, which acts as an interface for each process, managing requests to the server.

### Core Concepts

Each authentication flow leverages a set of core concepts to streamline and secure user interactions:

- **Token Management**: Handles user access tokens, including refreshing and invalidating tokens when necessary.
- **Session Persistence**: The application uses stores to persist session data, ensuring a consistent user experience across sessions.
- **Error Handling**: Authentication processes include specific error handling to manage login failures, invalid tokens, and other issues.
